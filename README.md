# ScrollScript
This is a project to scroll different versions of a script simultanously

<h1>Overview</h1>
The goal of this project is to scroll different versions of the same script, generated through LaTeX and with the same anchors, simultanously. This means, you only need one person to scroll through the script and anyone can see the current position inside their own version of the script with different highlighting on their monitors in real-time.
